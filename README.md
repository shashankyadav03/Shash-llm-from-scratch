## Introduction

This repository contains the codebase for creating a Large Language Model (LLM) from scratch. The LLM is designed to process and generate human-like text based on the input it receives. The purpose of this project is to understand the inner workings of LLMs, starting from the basics and advancing to a fully functional model.

## Features

- **Custom Tokenizer**: Implement your own tokenizer for preprocessing text data.
- **Model Architecture**: Build a transformer-based architecture.
- **Training Pipeline**: End-to-end training pipeline with data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Measure the performance of the model using various metrics.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shashankyadav03/Shash-llm-from-scratch.git
cd Shash-llm-from-scratch
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

You can start training the model by running:

```bash
python train.py --config configs/default.yaml
```

Replace `configs/default.yaml` with the path to your custom configuration file if needed.

## Data Preparation

Before training, ensure that your data is in the correct format. You can place your raw text data in the `data/raw/` directory. Preprocess the data using the custom tokenizer provided in the `src/tokenizer.py` file, which will output processed data into the `data/processed/` directory.

## Model Architecture

The model is based on the transformer architecture. You can find the implementation in `src/model.py`. The architecture is flexible, allowing for easy modifications and experiments.

## Training

To train the model, run the `train.py` script. You can customize the training configuration using the YAML files in the `configs/` directory.

Example:

```bash
python train.py --config configs/large_model.yaml
```

## Evaluation

After training, evaluate your model using the `evaluate.py` script. This will provide you with various metrics to gauge the performance of your model.

```bash
python evaluate.py --model_path checkpoints/model.pth
```
